# Pump

Put empty cells in the lleft slot of gui. The pump will fill them with a liquid wwhile absorbing source blocks under itself.

# Comments

Silver can be only from the "sorcery" mod.
All these machines require energy.
To give a machine energy, connect it to a generator, advanced generator, creative generator, diamond destructurizer or solar panel by wires.
To charge batbox, place power input between wire and batbox.
To discharge batbox, place power output between wire and batbox.
Sqeezer needs empty cells in the bottom slot of gui.
Enricher needs compost in the bottom slot of gui.
